Hilt
====

Hilt implements the boilerplate classes that are necessary to provide injection of `Application` and `Activity` `Context`'s and other Android specific objects when using Dagger.

##Usage##
*Coming soon...*

##Gradle##
Place `hilt-{version}.jar` into your `appModule/libs` folder.

Update your **build.gradle** to include the following:
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile files('libs/hilt-{version}.jar');
}
```

The library may be uploaded to Maven Central in the future. Stay tuned.
